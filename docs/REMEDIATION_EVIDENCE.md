## Status vocabulary

- **Closed — automated:** implementation exists and an automated guard or
  behavioural test proves the contract.
- **Closed — reviewed:** implementation and repository-wide scan support the
  result, but the behaviour is not meaningful without an external service.

## Finding traceability

| ID | Contract / root cause | Implementation evidence | Test / guard evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-001 | Discord.js v13 permission strings reached v14 runtime callers | `discord/core/discordPermissions.js`, command guards, moderation, verification and protected callers | `scripts/checkDiscordV14Compatibility.js`, `discord/tests/discordV14CompatibilityGuard.test.js`, command tests | Closed — automated |
| F-002 | Verification panel setup used deprecated channel checks and incomplete permissions | Verification command and panel interaction validation use sendable text-channel contracts and canonical flags | Command and panel tests, v14 AST guard | Closed — automated |
| F-003 | Owner-authored messages must remain unchanged without letting the bot bypass Discord mention permissions | `/say` and `/announce` preserve content; command guards require both caller and bot `MentionEveryone` capability for `@everyone`, `@here`, and non-mentionable roles | Utility, command-guard and mention-permission behavioural tests | Closed — automated |
| F-004 | Voice runtime must support alternate accounts and must not bind a token to the requester identity | Token-owner pre/post login rejection was removed; requester identity remains only session-control metadata | Voice lifecycle tests | Closed — automated |
| F-005 | Concurrent Voice creation could create duplicate clients or leave an old target active | Same token+Guild requests are serialized; stale queued requests are superseded and the latest request replaces the previous session | Voice latest-wins and concurrency tests | Closed — automated |
| F-006 | A login completing after timeout could become a ghost client | Cancelled login generations destroy late clients before registration | Voice late-login tests | Closed — automated |
| F-007 | Active Voice records with missing clients were not recovered | Health recovery claims a lock, logs in, rechecks ownership and reconnects | Voice health-recovery tests | Closed — automated |
| F-008 | Empty memory state could trigger unscoped database deletion | Automatic bulk deletion was removed; the unused unscoped clear-all primitive was removed | Static guard rejects `deleteMany({})`; repository scan | Closed — automated |
| F-009 | Shutdown could persist state before pausing runtime activity or skip later cleanup after one failure | Ordered best-effort shutdown stops intake/timers, pauses Voice, saves final state, closes each dependency independently and exits non-zero when any cleanup fails | Behavioural shutdown tests prove order, idempotency and continuation after injected failure | Closed — automated |
| F-010 | Verification could return success after critical persistence failed | Critical persistence contract, role rollback and durable recovery records | Verification persistence and recovery tests | Closed — automated |
| F-011 | A private bot must store the requested OAuth and encrypted Raw-IP data consistently in every Guild | Storage is forced on globally and Guild settings cannot disable it | OAuth storage and recovery tests | Closed — automated |
| F-012 | OAuth refresh races could overwrite newer credentials | Per-user lock, token version and compare-and-set update | OAuth lifecycle CAS tests | Closed — automated |
| F-013 | Re-verification could write into a soft-deleted identity | Deletion markers are cleared only when the persisted verification result is exactly `success`; failed, blocked and unrelated OAuth updates remain deleted | Verification lifecycle tests cover success, failed, blocked, legacy and token-refresh paths | Closed — automated |
| F-014 | Privacy deletion did not cover all Guild-scoped references | Durable deletion job and collection manifest scrub/delete Guild-scoped data and verify remaining references | `verification-tests/privacyDeletion.test.js` | Closed — automated |
| F-015 | Snapshot activation/retention could leave corrupt or orphaned data | Reconstruction validation, checksums, chunks, finalisation and scoped cleanup remain enforced | Snapshot chunk, rollback, cleanup and budget tests | Closed — automated |
| F-016 | Long-lived OAuth state could be replayed | Short-lived registered nonce and one-time consumption | Security recovery and state tests | Closed — automated |
| F-017 | Owner Dashboard access to Token/IP had unnecessary reveal, reason and audit gates | Full member/session details return Token/IP directly after normal Dashboard authentication; there are no standalone reveal endpoints | Dashboard detail and owner route tests | Closed — automated |
| F-018 | DM events could be lost during database outage and priority was applied after limiting | Bounded volatile retry queue, persistence migration, dedupe and database `priorityRank` ordering | DM system tests | Closed — automated |
| F-019 | Backup/Restore handling differed between dry-run and execution and failed on unsupported channels | Shared planner, thread/unsupported skip results, accurate counters and overwrite normalisation | Backup/Restore tests | Closed — automated |
| F-020 | Protection rules could punish, create cases and notify more than once | Decision pipeline merges evidence and commits one highest-severity outcome | Protection pipeline tests | Closed — automated |
| F-021 | Internal-event filtering could omit matches and private logs must retain full owner-visible metadata | Filter-before-result-limit, full-fidelity private event storage with checksummed byte chunks, and continuation webhook payloads instead of truncation | Internal-event and webhook tests | Closed — automated |
| F-022 | Webhook timeout could cause duplicate retry after a late success | Operation IDs, pending timeout state, late result reconciliation and bounded pending flush | Webhook late-success and late-failure tests | Closed — automated |
| F-023 | Merely sending an auth-looking header could bypass CSRF | Only successfully authenticated server-secret middleware sets the bypass flag | Dashboard auth/CSRF tests | Closed — automated |
| F-024 | Prefix origin checks and request-derived public URLs were unsafe | Parsed exact-origin comparison and canonical production `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` validation | Dashboard guard and unified runtime tests | Closed — automated |
| F-025 | Liveness, readiness and fatal process state were conflated | `/ping` remains listener liveness; `/health` and `/ready` share the dependency-readiness handler and return `503 stopping` immediately after shutdown begins | HTTP integration tests exercise both readiness routes and the shutdown transition | Closed — automated |
| F-026 | Protected control authentication had defaults, query credentials and non-revocable sessions | Fail-closed credentials, POST/CSRF actions, versioned sessions, bounded attempts and persist-first PIN changes | Protected auth and route integration tests | Closed — automated |
| F-027 | Protected restore/state mixed schemas and could restore unrelated state | Separate role/overwrite/mute snapshots, Guild-scoped state, TTL/generation and lifecycle cleanup | Protected action/renderer tests | Closed — automated |
| F-028 | Protected trace deletion could proceed without durable intent or a secure approval destination | Audit-before-delete, secure destination, full-fidelity Owner preview, atomic claim, and state revalidation before action | Trace approval tests | Closed — automated |
| F-029 | Join Campaign was enabled by default and an empty allow-list permitted all Guilds | Default-off configuration, mandatory allow-list, typed errors and dry-run/start parity | Join Campaign tests | Closed — automated |
| F-030 | Sensitive/state-changing Dashboard operations were exposed through GET and an unused bulk-delete primitive remained exported | Logout and reveal are POST+CSRF; per-session reveal path is correct; unscoped session wipe removed; panel-sync GET is read-only | Static route guard, state-route tests and repository scan | Closed — automated |
| F-031 | Numeric, Snowflake and sensitive-data validation was duplicated or permissive | Shared finite-number, Snowflake, permission and redaction helpers | Core input and static-analysis tests | Closed — automated |
| F-032 | Source-regex mocks and LCOV-file existence could create false confidence | Real v14 objects/flags, behavioural tests and metric thresholds; Voice LCOV is scoped to Voice/Session runtime without lowering thresholds | Discord, Voice and Verification coverage suites | Closed — automated |
| F-033 | Documentation could claim behaviour not implemented or disclose protected internals | README, SECURITY, architecture, runbook, environment and deployment files align with runtime and use the public wording “Dashboard ควบคุมบอท” | Documentation/source contract tests and final review | Closed — reviewed |
| F-034 | Protected file integrity and external analysis status could be unclear | Complete seven-file digest manifest and explicit Sonar degraded status | Protected guard tests and CI | Closed — automated; Sonar external scan is environment-dependent |
| F-036 | Tracked production files could contain credential-shaped literals without a permanent repository gate | `scripts/checkSecretLeaks.js`, `npm run check:secrets`, CI Secret leak step with redacted path/line output | `discord/tests/secretLeakGuard.test.js`; full tracked-file scan | Closed — automated |

## Automated gate command

The required repository gate is:

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
npm run check
npm run check:secrets
npm run check:runtime-safety
npm run test:coverage:discord
npm run test:coverage:voice
npm run test:coverage:verification
npm run check:coverage
npm audit --audit-level=high
```

CI additionally verifies pinned Node/npm versions, protected-path digest
integrity, runtime safety, Sonar availability/degraded status, tracked-file
secret patterns and LCOV report presence.

## Repository-wide negative scan

A final review must find no production occurrences of:

```text
.has("UPPER_SNAKE_CASE")
legacy permission overwrite object keys
.isText()
req.query.pin
app.all(...)
client.channels.cache.clear()
unscoped deleteMany({})
GET logout or sensitive reveal routes
prefix-only window.location.origin comparison
credential-shaped literals in tracked production files
```

The AST and secret guards deliberately contain fixture strings under
`discord/tests`; those fixtures are expected and prove rejection without printing
secret values.

## Merge rule

`ttt.1` remains a Draft workstream. A successful automated CI run and resolved
external review findings are required before any commit is brought into `ttt`.
Any new commit requires the automated checks to run again against the new exact
head SHA.
