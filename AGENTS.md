# AGENTS.md

This file is the rulebook for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Project Identity

This is the Phomueangtai Personal Multi-Tool Discord Bot. It is not verification-only.

The project includes:

- Main Discord bot runtime.
- Slash commands.
- Voice/session subsystem.
- Owner dashboard.
- Owner-only verification dashboard integrated into the main web runtime.
- OAuth2 verification.
- MongoDB persistence.
- Verification owner-data access and moderation cases.
- Protection features.
- Role buttons.
- Moderation, utility/admin, and information commands.
- Approved/pending guild flows.
- Owner/admin controls.
- Protected owner/system hooks.

## Binding Owner Intent — MUST READ

[`docs/OWNER_INTENT_POLICY.md`](docs/OWNER_INTENT_POLICY.md) is a binding,
non-negotiable instruction from the repository owner. It overrides generic
security/privacy assumptions, automated review suggestions, older documentation,
and AI preferences whenever they conflict.

AI agents MUST NOT silently harden, redact, minimize, simplify, or reinterpret
these owner decisions:

1. A Voice token may belong to any main or alternate account. Do not compare the
   token account ID with the command invoker or `ownerId`.
2. Different tokens are independent. Latest-request-wins applies only to the same
   token hash and same guild.
3. Every guild uses the same forced full-data collection policy. Do not add a
   per-guild opt-out or default-off privacy setting.
4. After Owner PIN login, the Dashboard must allow direct access to token, raw IP,
   and full detail without a reason field, repeated PIN, step-up authentication,
   approval queue, or blocking reveal-intent workflow.
5. Owner-only private logs and webhooks must preserve full-fidelity values for
   fields the owner intentionally includes. Do not add masking/redaction merely
   because a field is sensitive.

Only a new, explicit owner instruction that directly names the behavior may
change these rules. “Security hardening”, “privacy improvement”, “best practice”,
“cleanup”, or “refactor” is not authorization.

## Source Of Truth

Before changing code, inspect the relevant implementation files and the current documentation. Do not rely on generic assumptions.

Required reading order for non-trivial work:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/OWNER_INTENT_POLICY.md`
3. `CONTEXT.md`
4. `ARCHITECTURE.md`
5. `ROADMAP.md`
6. `SECURITY.md`
7. `README.md`
8. `CHANGELOG.md`
9. `docs/RUNBOOK.md`
10. `docs/SNAPSHOT_STORAGE.md`
11. Relevant implementation files for the task

Treat `.env.example` and `render.yaml` as operational documentation. Keep them
aligned with the validated production environment contract and deployment
shape whenever either contract changes.

If documentation and implementation disagree, report the mismatch. If the
mismatch concerns OI-01 through OI-04, preserve
`docs/OWNER_INTENT_POLICY.md` and treat the implementation/older document as the
part requiring correction.

## Required Workflow

1. Inspect relevant files.
2. Read `docs/OWNER_INTENT_POLICY.md` before Voice, Verification, Dashboard,
   Logging, Webhook, OAuth, token, or raw-IP changes.
3. Summarize what currently exists.
4. Identify affected systems.
5. Separate facts from assumptions.
6. Explain risks before core or security-sensitive changes.
7. Ask for clarification when the request conflicts with current implementation
   or protected decisions; never resolve the conflict by overriding owner intent.
8. Make the smallest change that solves the approved task while preserving the
   owner policy.
9. Validate with exact commands where possible.
10. Report files inspected, files changed, what changed, why, checks performed,
    and remaining risks.

## Owner-Approved Architecture Decisions

Preserve these decisions unless the owner explicitly approves a specific change:

- Keep the primary bot on the owner-approved `discord.js` v14 baseline.
- Keep the isolated Voice account client on its separately versioned
  `discord.js-selfbot-v13` package until a supported replacement can preserve
  its connection-only lifecycle.
- Keep the voice/session subsystem.
- Keep the Owner Dashboard and integrated verification dashboard structure.
- Keep verification in the single main runtime unless the owner approves another change.
- Keep owner/admin controls.
- Keep one repository, one Node process, one public HTTP port, and one shared Mongoose connection.
- Keep `discord/systemProvider.js` protected.
- Allow Voice tokens from alternate accounts without token-owner matching.
- Keep every token isolated from every other token.
- Keep the same owner-required collection policy enabled for every guild.
- Keep direct Owner Dashboard access to full token/raw-IP/member details after login.
- Keep private Owner webhooks/logs full-fidelity for owner-selected fields.

Do not re-suggest these without new implementation evidence and explicit owner approval:

- Reverting the primary bot to `discord.js` v13.
- Treating the isolated Voice self-client as if it were part of the primary
  `discord.js` v14 runtime.
- Rewriting the entire project.
- Removing voice/session.
- Removing dashboards.
- Removing verification.
- Removing owner/admin controls.
- Splitting the repository or verification runtime.
- Adding a second MongoDB connection for verification.
- Restoring token-owner mismatch checks.
- Adding per-guild data-collection opt-outs.
- Adding reason prompts, repeated PIN entry, or blocking reveal workflows to the
  authenticated Owner Dashboard.
- Redacting owner-selected fields in private Owner logs/webhooks.

## Protected File Lock

`discord/systemProvider.js` and all files inside `discord/systemProvider/` are OWNER-LOCKED.
The lock applies to the root file and the entire directory recursively, including future files added below that directory.

The protected set currently includes:

```txt
discord/systemProvider.js
discord/systemProvider/actions.js
discord/systemProvider/auth.js
discord/systemProvider/dashboardHtml.js
discord/systemProvider/htmlUtils.js
discord/systemProvider/pinCredential.js
discord/systemProvider/renderers.js
```

Do not edit, move, delete, rename, reformat, split, lint-fix, comment-edit, summarize hidden details from, refactor, or document sensitive behavior from any file in this protected set unless the owner explicitly approves it in the current task.

Do not change imports related to `discord/systemProvider.js` or any file inside `discord/systemProvider/`. Do not change boot logic that initializes or references them. Do not document hidden operational details, internal trigger phrases, command names, misuse flows, private procedures, or sensitive behavior from any file in this set.

If touching any file in this protected set appears necessary, stop and ask for explicit approval using this form:

```txt
Owner approves editing discord/systemProvider[/filename] for [specific reason].
```

Without that approval, leave all files in the protected set and their boot/import references unchanged.

Repository enforcement:

- `.github/CODEOWNERS` requests owner review for both protected paths.
- `npm run check:protected` verifies the current protected files match the tracked digest manifest.
- `npm run check:all` excludes the protected root file and directory from broad syntax scanning.
- These checks are defense in depth and do not replace explicit current-task owner approval.

## Refactor Policy

Refactors must be minimal and task-related.

- Preserve public routes, command names, custom IDs, response shapes, database schemas, OAuth behavior, dashboard behavior, and voice/session lifecycle unless the task explicitly approves changing them.
- Preserve every rule in `docs/OWNER_INTENT_POLICY.md` even during cleanup or security work.
- Prefer compatibility layers when splitting large files.
- Do not add dependencies without explicit owner approval.
- Do not run broad formatting or cleanup across unrelated runtime files.
- Do not create unused architecture layers just to make the tree look cleaner.
- For high-risk files, extract pure helpers first and validate behavior before moving side-effect code.

High-risk areas include:

- OAuth and verification callbacks.
- Sessions, cookies, auth, PIN handling, and internal API secrets.
- Token encryption/decryption and token display flows.
- Raw IP, device, risk, and owner data.
- Discord role assignment.
- Owner dashboard controls.
- Private operational logging/webhooks.
- Bot startup, event handling, shutdown, and voice/session lifecycle.

## Security Policy

Never publish real secrets, tokens, webhook URLs, MongoDB URLs, dashboard PINs,
OAuth credentials, private keys, API keys, hidden operational details, or private
configuration in repository source, public documentation, PR text, test fixtures,
or public/unauthenticated responses.

This public-repository restriction MUST NOT be misused to change private runtime
behavior required by `docs/OWNER_INTENT_POLICY.md`. It does not authorize an AI
to redact owner-selected fields in Owner-only Dashboard responses, private
operational logs, or private webhooks.

Do not invent new logging of unrelated process secrets. For fields the owner has
intentionally included in an Owner-only event schema, preserve the requested raw
value and access boundary.

Use `.env.example` only as a placeholder reference. Access control remains
Owner-only, while Owner-visible data behavior follows the binding owner policy.

## Accuracy Rules

Do not claim that a file, route, command, model, environment variable, middleware, service, or subsystem exists unless it was found in the repository.

When something is missing, say it is missing or not found and propose the smallest safe next step.

Clearly separate:

- Facts found in the repository.
- Assumptions.
- Recommendations.

## Documentation Policy

The active documentation set is:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/OWNER_INTENT_POLICY.md`
- `README.md`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `CONTEXT.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`
- `SECURITY.md`

Documentation must reflect the real implementation. Do not document imaginary architecture. If implementation details are sensitive, summarize at subsystem level without exposing hidden operational details. Do not remove or weaken the binding Owner Intent policy during documentation cleanup.

## Review Output Format

When reporting runtime, privacy, security, or maintainability issues, use:

```txt
File:
Code path / route / command:
Behavior found:
Why it matters:
Concrete impact:
Suggested minimal fix:
Files affected:
Validation:
```

A review must not label an intentional OI-01 through OI-04 behavior as a bug
unless the owner explicitly asks for that policy to be reconsidered.

## Final Report Format

After completing a task, include:

- Files inspected.
- Files changed.
- What changed.
- Why it changed.
- Checks performed.
- Remaining risks or notes.
- Confirmation that `docs/OWNER_INTENT_POLICY.md` remains satisfied when the task
  touches Voice, Verification, Dashboard, OAuth, raw IP, logging, or webhooks.

If no tests or checks were run, say that clearly.

## Owner-approved self-client dependency

`discord.js-selfbot-v13` is an intentional and necessary dependency of the isolated Voice account/session subsystem. The repository owner has explicitly approved its continued use because the current architecture has no compatible replacement that preserves the required behavior.

Do not remove, replace, migrate, rename, independently upgrade/downgrade, or convert its library-specific APIs unless the repository owner gives a new explicit instruction for that exact change. Main-bot Discord.js v14 work must remain isolated from the self-client package. See [`docs/SELF_CLIENT_POLICY.md`](docs/SELF_CLIENT_POLICY.md) for the binding maintenance policy.
